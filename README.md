# Crypto-Technical-Analysis-Trading-Bot
A bot that calculates the RSI and MACD momentum indicators of any crypto coin on binance and automatically purchases based off the indicators. The bot sends a text message to the users cell phone when a transaction is made. 

## About  
Being a long time follower of financial markets such as the stock market and the crypto market, I wanted a way to trade on the market without having to always do the analysis, purchases, and selling while I am busy. This project was created to do all that work in the background for the user, and sends the user updates to their cell phone through SMS as soon as a transaction is made. 

The bot uses two momentum indicators:

1. Relative Strength Index ([RSI](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp))
  - Bot default Buying Condition: RSI < 30
  - Bot default Selling Condition: RSI > 70

2. Average Convergence/Divergence ([MACD](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/macd.asp))
  - Bot default Buying Condition: MACD > 0
  - Bot default Selling Condition:  MACD < 0 
  
**Defualt Conditions**

    When both RSI and MACD buying conditions are met, the bot will buy. 

    When both RSI and MACD selling conditions are met, the bot will sell. 

**Results**

   Through backtesting 2021 ETH USD data, this bot would have given a return of ~6.54% in 2021.
